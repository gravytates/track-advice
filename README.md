Logic is broken into an if/else statement with one nested if/else if/else if/else sub-statement. User warnings are displayed for incomplete forms using five additional individual if/else statements. Results contain extra info about specific advice/track. Extra addition of a background color changing button that toggles between a scenic photo with dark text and a black background with white text._
